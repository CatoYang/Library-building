# Foreword
In light of previous coding failures and being unable to understand the syntax of pandas simply because i dont have sufficient experience in it. i have decided that it would be better to create a library to for use in data processing.

there are 2 major problems i wish to resolve
1. Overeliance on object orient programing (OOP): Started learning OOP and wish make code more functional. This is crucial in readability and cooperation with potential teamates until i can align with their own libraries. 
2. Speed of coding: In challenges and evalutation of coding ability, the ability to code quickly is a highly weighted metric.  Creating a library to speed it up will be beneficial.

# Dependencies
Pandas as pd  
regex as re  


# Usage
Import the file, preferably as 

import data_preprocessing as dp  

if in a jupyter notebook, you can use the command '%run data_processing.py'

# Defined functions and use
